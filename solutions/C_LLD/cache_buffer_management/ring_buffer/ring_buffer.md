# Ring Buffer (Circular Buffer)

#### Description
A ring buffer, also known as a circular buffer, is a fixed-size data structure that uses a single, continuous buffer for reading and writing operations in a circular manner. It allows efficient use of memory and is especially useful in scenarios where data needs to be overwritten periodically, without the need for shifting data after every operation.

#### Key Concepts

- **Buffer Management:** The buffer is pre-allocated with a fixed size, ensuring a constant amount of memory usage.
- **Circular Structure:** The buffer "wraps around" when it reaches the end, reusing the buffer from the beginning once it’s full, making it a circular structure.
- **Memory Efficiency:** A ring buffer allows continuous and efficient reading and writing of data without reallocation or data movement, reducing overhead and increasing performance.

### Problem and Usage Scenarios

1. **Efficient Data Stream Handling:**  
   The core problem solved by a ring buffer is managing continuous streams of data where new data is continuously being produced, and older data might no longer be relevant or needed. By overwriting old data when the buffer is full, it efficiently manages limited memory resources without requiring frequent memory allocation or reallocation.

2. **Handling Fixed-Size Buffers:**  
   A ring buffer is helpful when the system needs to maintain a fixed-size buffer but also continuously write and read data. This can be useful in embedded systems, real-time applications, and networking scenarios where memory is limited, and it’s crucial to avoid memory fragmentation or overflow.

### Common Scenarios of Implementation

1. **Producer-Consumer Problems:**  
   A common use case for a ring buffer is where one or more producers generate data and one or more consumers read that data. A circular buffer helps avoid locking issues since the buffer manages its space automatically, ensuring that producers don't overwrite data that hasn’t been read yet by consumers.

2. **Real-Time Data Streams:**  
   In real-time systems like audio and video processing, ring buffers are often used to store streams of data in a temporary buffer. For example, in a sound system, incoming audio samples are continuously written into the buffer, while playback reads the samples in real-time.

3. **Networking Buffers:**  
   Ring buffers are widely used in network drivers to store packets temporarily while they are being processed or transmitted. This allows efficient packet queuing and processing without the need for complex memory management systems.

4. **Embedded Systems:**  
   Many embedded systems use ring buffers to manage data where memory is constrained. They are a great solution for handling sensor data or serial communication streams, providing an efficient way to store and process incoming data.

### Objective

The primary goal of implementing a ring buffer is to maintain a continuous flow of data between producers and consumers without the need for costly memory management operations like resizing or shifting data. This helps in maintaining consistent performance and efficient use of memory, especially in time-critical systems.

### Implimentation Explanation

#### Circular Buffer Structure:
- The buffer is an array of fixed size `BUFFER_SIZE`.
- The `head` points to the next write position.
- The `tail` points to the next read position.
- The `size` keeps track of how many elements are currently in the buffer.

#### Write Operation:
- Data is written at the position pointed by `head`.
- If the buffer is full, the oldest data (pointed by `tail`) is overwritten, and the `tail` moves forward.

#### Read Operation:
- Data is read from the position pointed by `tail`.
- The `tail` moves forward after reading an element.

#### Edge Cases:
- **Full Buffer:** When the buffer is full, the oldest data is overwritten.
- **Empty Buffer:** When the buffer is empty, no read operation is allowed.
