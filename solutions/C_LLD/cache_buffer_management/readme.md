# Cache and Buffer Management

- **Cache Simulation**: Simulate the behavior of different caching mechanisms (e.g., LRU, FIFO).

- **Double Buffering**: Implement double buffering for concurrent read/write operations.

- **Ring Buffer (Circular Buffer)**: Implement a circular buffer for efficient data storage and retrieval.

- **Bounded Buffer Problem**: Solve the bounded buffer problem using semaphores.
