## Synchronization and Multithreading

### Readers-Writers Problem
Solve the readers-writers synchronization problem using semaphores or mutexes.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Semaphores**: To manage access and ensure mutual exclusion.
- **Mutexes**: To protect shared resources and control access.
- **Concurrency**: Handling multiple threads accessing shared resources.

### Producer-Consumer Problem
Implement a solution to the producer-consumer problem using a bounded buffer.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Bounded Buffer**: A fixed-size buffer that holds items produced by the producer and consumed by the consumer.
- **Synchronization**: Ensures that producers do not overwrite and consumers do not consume from an empty buffer.

### Semaphore and Mutex Usage
Demonstrate proper usage of semaphores and mutexes in a multi-threaded application.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Semaphore**: Controls access to a resource pool.
- **Mutex**: Provides mutual exclusion to prevent simultaneous access to a shared resource.

### Thread Pool Design
Implement a thread pool that manages and reuses threads for task execution.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Thread Pool**: A collection of worker threads that efficiently manage and execute tasks.
- **Task Scheduling**: Distributing tasks to available threads and managing workload.

### Atomic Operations and Lock-Free Data Structures
Implement lock-free data structures using atomic operations.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Atomic Operations**: Operations that are performed as a single unit of work without interruption.
- **Lock-Free Data Structures**: Data structures that allow multiple threads to operate concurrently without locks.
