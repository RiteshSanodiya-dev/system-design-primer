Timer-Related LLD Interview Questions
Implement a Timer Wheel

Description: Design a timer wheel data structure to efficiently manage and schedule multiple timers. The timer wheel should handle timer additions, cancellations, and expirations with minimal overhead.
Key Concepts: Circular buffers, hashing, time slots, efficient lookup and insertion.
High-Resolution Timer Scheduler

Description: Create a high-resolution timer scheduler that can handle timers with microsecond precision. Ensure that the scheduler can manage a large number of concurrent timers without significant performance degradation.
Key Concepts: Priority queues, binary heaps, precision timing, interrupt handling.
Timer Queue Implementation

Description: Implement a timer queue that supports adding, removing, and executing timers based on their expiration times. The queue should process timers in the correct order and handle edge cases like simultaneous expirations.
Key Concepts: Linked lists, min-heaps, event-driven programming, callback functions.
Implementing setitimer and signal Handling

Description: Mimic the functionality of the setitimer system call by implementing your own timer that sends signals (e.g., SIGALRM) after a specified interval. Handle signal registration and ensure safe signal handling within your program.
Key Concepts: Signal handling, interrupt-driven design, system calls simulation.
Debounce Mechanism Using Timers

Description: Design a debounce mechanism for handling rapid, successive events (e.g., button presses) using timers. Ensure that only the final event after a specified interval is processed.
Key Concepts: Event filtering, timer resets, state management.
Timeout Handling in Network Protocols

Description: Implement timeout mechanisms for network protocols (e.g., TCP retransmission timers). Ensure that retransmissions occur correctly after timeouts and handle timer resets upon successful acknowledgments.
Key Concepts: Networking protocols, state machines, retransmission strategies.
Implement a Delayed Task Executor

Description: Create a delayed task executor that schedules tasks to be executed after a certain delay. Ensure thread safety and efficient task management.
Key Concepts: Multithreading, synchronization, task scheduling, condition variables.
Rate Limiter Using Token Bucket with Timers

Description: Implement a rate limiter using the token bucket algorithm, where tokens are refilled at regular intervals using timers. Ensure that the limiter correctly enforces the rate limits under varying loads.
Key Concepts: Token bucket algorithm, rate limiting, timer-based token refilling.
Periodic Task Scheduler

Description: Design a scheduler that can handle periodic tasks, executing them at regular intervals. Ensure that the scheduler can adjust for drift and handle tasks that take variable execution times.
Key Concepts: Scheduling algorithms, drift correction, periodic execution.
Implementing a Sleep Function Without Blocking

Description: Create a non-blocking sleep function that allows other tasks to execute while waiting for the sleep duration to elapse. Use timers to manage the sleep duration.
Key Concepts: Asynchronous programming, event loops, timer callbacks.
Alarm Management System

Description: Develop an alarm management system where multiple alarms can be set, modified, and triggered at specified times. Ensure efficient handling of alarm conflicts and prioritization.
Key Concepts: Priority queues, event handling, time comparison.
Real-Time Clock (RTC) Driver Simulation

Description: Simulate a Real-Time Clock (RTC) driver that keeps track of the current time and allows setting alarms or timers based on RTC interrupts.
Key Concepts: Hardware interfacing simulation, interrupt handling, timekeeping.
Implementing a Watchdog Timer

Description: Design a watchdog timer that monitors system health and resets the system if it becomes unresponsive within a specified timeframe.
Key Concepts: System monitoring, reset mechanisms, timer expiration handling.
Efficient Timer Cancellation Mechanism

Description: Implement an efficient mechanism to cancel active timers. Ensure that the cancellation process does not degrade the performance of the timer management system.
Key Concepts: Data structure optimization, concurrency control, resource management.
Simulating Timer Interrupts in a Multithreaded Environment

Description: Create a simulation of timer interrupts in a multithreaded C program. Ensure that timer callbacks are executed correctly without causing race conditions.

Tips for Preparing Timer-Related LLD Questions
Understand Different Timer Implementations: Familiarize yourself with various timer data structures like timer wheels, priority queues, and linked lists. Understand their trade-offs in terms of complexity and performance.

Concurrency and Synchronization: Many timer-related problems involve concurrent operations. Ensure you understand thread synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables.

Efficiency and Optimization: Focus on designing timer systems that are efficient in terms of time and space. Consider how to handle a large number of timers without significant performance penalties.

Edge Cases and Robustness: Think about how your timer implementation handles edge cases, such as timer expirations occurring simultaneously, timer cancellations, and system clock changes.

Practical Applications: Relate your solutions to real-world applications like network protocols, operating system schedulers, and embedded systems to demonstrate practical understanding.

By practicing these timer-related low-level design problems, you'll strengthen your ability to handle time-sensitive and concurrent tasks in C, which are crucial skills for system-level programming and embedded systems development.
