## Explanation

### Queue Operations

- `initializeQueue`: Initializes a queue.
- `isQueueEmpty`: Checks if the queue is empty.
- `isQueueFull`: Checks if the queue is full.
- `enqueue`: Adds an element to the queue.
- `dequeue`: Removes an element from the queue.
- `front`: Retrieves the front element of the queue.

### Stack Operations

- `initializeStack`: Initializes a stack using two queues (`q1` and `q2`).
- `isStackEmpty`: Checks if the stack is empty.
- `push`: Adds an element to the stack. This involves:
  - Transferring elements from `q1` to `q2`.
  - Adding the new item to `q1`.
  - Transferring elements back from `q2` to `q1`.
  This process effectively reverses the order of elements to maintain stack behavior.
- `pop`: Removes an element from the stack.
- `top`: Retrieves the top element of the stack.

### Main Function

The main function:
- Initializes the stack.
- Pushes a few elements onto the stack.
- Pops an element from the stack and prints the results.
