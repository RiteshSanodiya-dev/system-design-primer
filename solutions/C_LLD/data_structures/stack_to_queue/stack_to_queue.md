## Explanation

### Data Structures

- **Stack**: Implements basic stack operations such as `push`, `pop`, and `peek`.
- **Queue**: Implements basic queue operations such as `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `front`.

### Conversion Function

The `stackToQueue` function converts a stack to a queue by first transferring elements from the stack to a temporary stack and then from the temporary stack to the queue. This process reverses the order of elements to align with queue behavior.

### Main Function

Demonstrates stack-to-queue conversion by:
1. Pushing elements onto the stack.
2. Converting the stack to a queue.
3. Printing the elements from the queue.

Feel free to adjust the capacity and other parameters as needed for your specific use case.
